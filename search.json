    "text": "These pages provide documentation and support on how to navigate the living metadata catalog of open-access geospatial datasets for climate risk assessments (CRAs).\n\n\nKey principles\n\nRisk framework: The catalog follows the risk framework of the IPCC’s 5th and 6th Assessment Reports (AR5, AR6) where risk results from the interaction of hazards, the elements exposed to these hazards as well as the vulnerability of the exposed elements.\nFAIR data: The catalog includes data with an open-access license only, thereby facilitating the provision of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data (Wilkinson et al. 2016).\nCommunity-driven development: To allow for continuous development by the CRA community, the catalog is hosted in a collaborative environment with the opportunity to contribute further datasets (see How to contribute).\n\n\n\n\nTechnical implementation\n\nSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC): The STAC specification provides the underlying common standard of the living catalog, allowing for structuring and querying geospatial metadata. STAC can flexibly accommodate a variety metadata attributes relevant for CRAs.\nSTAC Browser: All data included in the living catalog can be explored in a browsable webpage.\n\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\nScientific article: The development of the living catalog is described in Reimann et al (in prep) [link will follow upon publication].\nCLIMAAX project: The catalog has been developed as part of the Horizon Europe project CLIMAAX, which develops a harmonized framework and toolbox for CRAs across Europe. The catalog provides as a pool of possible data sources for a variety of CRA approaches (‘risk workflows’)."
