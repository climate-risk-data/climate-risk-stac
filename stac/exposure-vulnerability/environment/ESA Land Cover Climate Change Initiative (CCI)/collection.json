  "description": "The ESA Land Cover Climate Change Initiative Project is part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative to produce long term datasets of Essential Climate Variables (ECV's) from historic satellite data. Land cover is defined as the (bio) physical cover at the earth surface including grass, trees, bare ground and water. Land cover is fundamental to better understand the climate through the estimation and validation of fluxes of water, carbon, and energy. It plays a role in adaptation and mitigation assessments at various scales.",
