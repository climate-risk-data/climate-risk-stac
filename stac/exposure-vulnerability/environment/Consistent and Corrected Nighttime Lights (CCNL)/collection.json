  "description": "DMSP-OLS provides the longest observations of NTL information, from 1992 to 2013, an unparalleled dataset for studying historical artificial lights. Version 4 of the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series is widely used ( Image and data processing by NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center. DMSP data collected by US Air Force Weather Agency ). However, it suffers from three main problems: inter-annual inconsistency, saturation, and blooming effect. We used a  series of methods to mitigate the impact and improve data quality. After processing, we get consistent and corrected nighttime light dataset (CCNL).",
