  "description": "As the pioneer of the nocturnal remote sensing technology, Earth Observation Group (EOG) had been collecting nighttime satellite imagery and produce global Nighttime Light map with highest quality. The history of Nighttime Light map produced by EOG can trace back early as 1994, with the Operational Linescan Sensor (OLS) onboard Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. Since the launch of the latest generation of earth observation satellite, the Joint Polar-orbiting Satellite System (JPSS), the Visible and Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) Day Night Band (DNB) on board of JPSS satellites provides astounding improvement on low light imaging compared to DMSP-OLS.
