    "description": "Building Exposure Model: This global dataset on exposure includes country-specific building typology, usage, and value in both urban and rural settings. The dataset utilizes the count of individuals categorized by socio-economic class residing within a specific construction style in a defined geographic area as a foundation for distributing the exposed economic value of the building stock. Built-up, as people, have been divided into three sector classes: housing sector distribution, service sector distribution and industrial sector distribution. All the data (socio-economic, building type and capital stock) are provided through a uniform geographical unit that are the reference grid at 5x5 km at equator.",
