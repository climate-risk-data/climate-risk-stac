  "description": "GAEZ v4 is the most ambitious global assessment to date and this Data Portal has been developed to make the database widely and easily accessible for users. It comprises a large volume of spatial natural resources indicators and results of agro-ecological crop analysis. Results are presented in a regular raster format of 5 arc-minute (about 9 x 9 km at the equator) grid cells. Selected maps related to AEZ classification, soil suitability, terrain slopes and land cover are provided at 30 arc-second (0.9 x 0.9 km) resolution. The GAEZ v4 update includes 2010 baseline data comprising land cover, a harmonized global soil database and terrain data, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value. Climatic conditions are based on a time series of historical data of 1961-2010 and a selection of future climate simulations using recent IPCC AR5 Earth System Model (ESM) outputs for four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).",
