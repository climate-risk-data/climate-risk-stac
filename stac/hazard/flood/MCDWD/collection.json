  "description": "The Flood Product is a daily, near-global, ~250 m resolution product showing flood and surface water detected from the twice-daily overpass of the MODIS optical sensors (onboard Terra and Aqua satellites). To minimize false-positives from cloud and terrain shadows, we employ a multi-observation compositing approach, and generate the product over three compositing periods (1-day, 2-day, and 3-day).",
