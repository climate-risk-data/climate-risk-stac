  "description": "The Aqueduct Floods Hazard Maps for riverine floods were produced using the GLOFRIS model with global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, producing long-term simulations of river discharges and flood levels for several climate conditions. Forcing was derived from the EUWATCH and ISIMIP meteorological datasets over various periods between 1950 and 2099. Extreme value statistics were applied to derive floodplain water volumes per grid cell for a set of return periods (2, 5, ... 250, 500 years) under current climate ca. 1980 (1960-1999), in 2030 (2010-2049), 2050 (2030-2069) and 2070 (2060-2099). The Aqueduct Floods Hazard Maps for coastal floods were produced using the GLOFRIS model, based on the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR) dataset and sea-level rise projections from the RISES-AM project. The resulting flood maps have a resolution of 30''x30''.",
