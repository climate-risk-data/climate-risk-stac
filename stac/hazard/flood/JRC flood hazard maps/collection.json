  "description": "The datasets included in this collection depict flood prone areas in Europe and the World for river flood events of different magnitude, i.e. different six return periods from 1-in-10-year to 1-in-500-year events. The maps have been developed using hydrological and hydrodynamic models, driven by the climatological data of the European and Global Flood Awareness Systems (EFAS and GloFAS). European-scale maps comprise most of the geographical Europe and all the river basins entering the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the Caucasus, Middle East and Northern Africa countries.",
