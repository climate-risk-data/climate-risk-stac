  "description": "This is a community catalog containing datasets for the three risk drivers Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability. This first version of the catalog (released XXXX) focusses on global-scale datasets that can be used as input in climate risk assessments (CRA). We provide detailed documentation on how to navigate the catalog, including a user guide (see 'Catalog documentation'). The development of the catalog is described in detail in the referenced publication (see 'Peer-reviewed publication'). As the catalog is designed to be a community-led endeavor, we encourage risk data users to add datasets to this catalog, thereby creating a growing knowledge base for potential users. New datasets can be submitted via GitHub (see 'Submit a new dataset').",
