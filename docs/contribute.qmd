title: "How to contribute"

To make this a *living* catalog, it needs to be continuously updated and expanded by its users. We therefore encourage all users to **report inconsistencies**, missing information, or malfunctions, and to **contribute new or missing datasets**. 


### Data criteria
-	**CRA data**: The data must be relevant for climate risk assessments (CRAs), reflecting one of the risk determinants as defined in [IPCC AR6](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-ii/): hazard, exposure, vulnerability, or response.
-	**Geospatial data**: Only geospatial datasets in raster format, vector data (i.e. points, polygons, polylines) at a subnational level (i.e. administrative units), or tabular data that include coordinates are included.
-	**Open-access license**: The dataset must be available under an open-access license with a persistent identifier assigned to it.
-	**Publication**: The dataset must have a transparent documentation of the methods used for producing the data and should preferably be published in the peer-reviewed literature.

::: {.callout-note}
While the catalog has so far focused on global-scale CRA data, all **spatial scales** (i.e. regional, national, subnational) can be added.

### Quality control
-	**Validation**: The repository developers check the suggested data entries for
    -   Data criteria (see above)
    -   Completeness of the data entry
-	**New data entry**: If validation is successful, the data entry is added to the living catalog
-	**Revision**: If the data do not meet the quality criteria, the data contributor is asked to revise their data entry
