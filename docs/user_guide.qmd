The catalog is visualized in STAC Browser which transforms it into a **browsable webpage**. The catalog is structured into several **nested levels** that constitute the underlying folder structure. 
The following steps ease browsing, selecting, and accessing the (meta)data included in the catalog.

## Step-by-step browsing

1. Access the living metadata catalog via [STAC Browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-risk-data/climate-risk-stac/refs/heads/gh-pages/stac/catalog.json)

2. Navigate to **hazard** (i.e. climate) or **exposure-vulnerability** (i.e. socioeconomic) to browse the respective data entries:

Catalogs can be **filtered** by title, descriptions, and keywords. Additionally, datasets can be filtered by selecting attributed **keywords**.

4. Choose a dataset from the listed **data sources** ('collections'). Collections contain the metadata attributes that all data entries have in common (e.g. keywords, license, temporal extent, data provider):

5.  Choose a specific **data entry** ('item') . Items list a range of metadata attributes including at least one **asset**, provides access to the data download:
