We provide a **living metadata catalog** of publicly available geospatial datasets for climate risk assessments (CRAs), which can be browsed, selected, and accessed based on a variety of technical specifications and information relevant for CRAs. The living catalog is based on the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification and visualized in STAC Browser.

The current version of the catalog includes **hazard, exposure and vulnerability datasets**, which are grouped into a) climate processes (i.e. hazard) and b) socioeconomic processes (i.e. exposure and vulnerability):
